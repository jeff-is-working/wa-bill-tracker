## Getting Started

### Use the live site

Visit **[wa-bill-tracker.org](https://wa-bill-tracker.org)** — no setup needed.

### Deploy your own instance

Follow the steps below in order. Everything you need is here.

#### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
# Fork via GitHub UI, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wa-bill-tracker.git
cd wa-bill-tracker
```

#### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install requests    # Only runtime dependency
pip install pytest      # For running tests
```

#### 3. Fetch initial bill data

```bash
python scripts/fetch_all_bills.py
```

This creates `data/bills.json`, `data/stats.json`, and `data/manifest.json` by pulling from the WA Legislature SOAP API.

#### 4. Test locally

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

#### 5. Run tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

#### 6. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings > Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **main**, folder: **/ (root)**
4. Click Save

Your site will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/wa-bill-tracker`.

#### 7. Enable GitHub Actions (automated data sync)

1. Go to the **Actions** tab
2. Click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**

Two workflows will run automatically:
- **fetch-data.yml** — Syncs bill data twice daily (6 AM / 6 PM Pacific) + weekly full refresh (Sundays 2 AM Pacific)
- **deploy.yml** — Runs tests, validates data, and deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to main

#### 8. Custom domain (optional)

1. Register your domain
2. Add it to Cloudflare (or your DNS provider) with these records:

   | Type | Name | Content | Proxy |
   |------|------|---------|-------|
   | A | `@` | `185.199.108.153` | DNS only |
   | A | `@` | `185.199.109.153` | DNS only |
   | A | `@` | `185.199.110.153` | DNS only |
   | A | `@` | `185.199.111.153` | DNS only |
   | CNAME | `www` | `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io` | DNS only |

3. Create a `CNAME` file in the repo root with your domain name
4. In GitHub repo **Settings > Pages > Custom domain**, enter your domain and enable **Enforce HTTPS**
5. Wait for DNS propagation and certificate provisioning (usually minutes, up to 24 hours)

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for Cloudflare SSL settings and troubleshooting.

## Adapting for Other States

This app can be adapted for any state with a public legislative API:

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Replace the API integration in `scripts/fetch_all_bills.py` for your state's data source
3. Update `APP_CONFIG` in `app.js` (site name, session dates, cutoff dates, bill types)
4. Update bill type filters in `index.html`
5. Run tests and deploy
